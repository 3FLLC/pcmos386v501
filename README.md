# This is the initial release of PC-MOS/386 v5.01; the latest released version. 


* includes sources
* includes the executables
* maybe more

* does atm NOT include the borland compiler/tools -- not sure if releasing them here is OK.
  (will have to find out -- else I will document it all for you)
