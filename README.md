# This is the initial release of PC-MOS/386 v5.01; the latest released version. 

This tree:

* includes sources
* includes the executables
* includes the cdrom driver from Rod Roark (sources)
* maybe more

* does atm NOT include the borland compiler/tools -- not sure if releasing them here is OK.
  (will have to find out -- else I will document it all for you)

In concert with Gary Robertson and Rod Roark it has been decided to place all under GPL v3.

The PC-MOS386 v5.01 API itself has been documented in Ralf Brown's interrupt list
